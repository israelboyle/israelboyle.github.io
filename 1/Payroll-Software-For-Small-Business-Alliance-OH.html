Restaurant point of sale (POS) software provides restaurant and bar servers an easy way to take orders and process payment for multiple checks simultaneously. Capturing data at the time and place of sale.</p>
<p>This method of inventory management is more effective than the limited system, and when combined with strong loss-prevention procedures can result in large cost reductions per month. Host Jon Taffer recently endorsed many of our award winning point of sale systems to help struggling bars and nightclubs improve their efficiency and profitability. After testing dozens of POS systems, we found TouchBistro to be a top-of-the-line EMV-compliant system that also integrates an end-to-end restaurant management system.</p>

POS systems now integrate more seamlessly with other back-end applications such as customer relationship management (CRM) and inventory management.</p>

Utilizing features like inventory management will help you find where to cut food costs and to boost profit margins by using recipe costing. But, using a POS that is tailored to retail isn't wise because a restaurant is a completely different business with different needs.

Instead of an employee double-checking inventory or reconciling the cash register with the sales, the software performs the action. A cloud-based restaurant POS does both by providing an efficient system to modify menus and prices. Integration with 3rd Party Apps â€” businesses using POS systems need to make their data available to their ERP and accounting applications.</p>
