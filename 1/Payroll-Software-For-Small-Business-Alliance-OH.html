Host Jon Taffer recently endorsed many of our award winning point of sale systems to help struggling bars and nightclubs improve their efficiency and profitability. After testing dozens of POS systems, we found TouchBistro to be a top-of-the-line EMV-compliant system that also integrates an end-to-end restaurant management system.</p>

POS systems now integrate more seamlessly with other back-end applications such as customer relationship management (CRM) and inventory management.</p>

Utilizing features like inventory management will help you find where to cut food costs and to boost profit margins by using recipe costing.

Integration with 3rd Party Apps — businesses using POS systems need to make their data available to their ERP and accounting applications.</p>
