<p>Bar staff often work without direct supervision and liquor waste and theft is hard to detect or prevent. All types of restaurants and bars match process flow to AccuPOS' adaptive system with touch screen, PC, handheld, and tablet. ShopKeep's inventory management module, while made for retailers, does a great job of managing restaurant inventory. To keep the service and guest experience seamless, you need a nightclub or bar POS system that can keep up with the rush. The POS hardware you need for your bar will typically include a tablet, tablet stand, receipt printer, cash drawer, and credit card terminal or card reader.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that it's often more expensive and the hardware is probably going to be unusable if you switch POS software.

Another feature-rich free POS software is Linga , which is designed specifically for food service businesses. This way, you're saving customers from disappointment and you're saving sales.
