<p>For any restaurant, point of sale technology is important. Retailers can reasonably expect to acquire such systems (including hardware) for about $4000 US (as of 2009) per checkout lane. Sometimes, even after spending a lot of valuable time searching for the best possible system, restaurant owners end up making a mistake by basing their final decision on cost alone. Stock Visibility â€” keeping track of product movement can help retailers avoid stock-outs or dead stocks and thus improve customer relationships.</p>

<p>AlfaRichi EPOS is a point-of-sale software solution with features such as web-based front-end and back-office system and multi-device accessibility. Self-service grocery stores such as Piggly Wiggly , beginning in 1916, allowed customers to fetch their own items and pass the point of sale on the way to the exit. 3.

<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity. At the same time, a good POS system will allow you to accept cash, credit, and contactless payments and some will even let you accept online payments for your products and services.</p>
