The good news is you can always find a different restaurant POS solution, either as a standalone product, or bundled within a larger venue management kit with multiple attractive functionalities. The ETP Omni-channel Store provides your customers a seamless experience across all your stores, e-commerce sites and other touch points. We are hardware retailers who could not find a POS solution that completely met our needs, so we developed it ourselves.</p>
<p>The hardware of a POS system consists of the physical setup like cash register connected to a PC or server, or even a portable device such as a tablet or smartphone connected to a cloud-hosted system. The TouchBistro hardware setup is simple and low cost and the licensing fees are also cheap compared to the gigantic POS systems of yore. Hardware investments are minimal, and the system is cheaper to set up than most traditional bar POS systems because it is compatible with third-party POS equipment.</p>
<p>Its solutions include POS software, traditional POS hardware systems with touchscreen monitors, and mobile POS systems that use tablets. You have secure access to your data anywhere across multiple stores, and new features are always a free update away. And to top it off, Square for Restaurant comes with all the fundamental features you'd want from a restaurant POS system. With this plan you will receive inventory management for up to 1,000 products, sales analytics, the ability to send digital receipts, employee and customer management features, plus mobile connectivity and the ability to sell offline.</p>

<p>A good POS system will log the number and value of the sales you've made, as well as tracking your inventory and letting you know when to restock. Disregarding that fact for the time being, compare a retail store with a POS System to an almost identical store with a standard electronic cash register - there are much differences than first meets the eye. Designed for small, medium, and large businesses, the system can be deployed as an online-based service, on-premise, and mobile point-of-sale solution.</p>

The POS features include cash management, table management, and delivery management. The POS system captures the details of the reason for the return, salesperson's name, and remarks. Mobile POS systems are Cloud-based and substantially cheaper (but may be leaner in terms of extras).</p>
<p>More than a POS system, Toast POS provides a comprehensive restaurant management system that streamlines front-end and back-office processes. An effective inventory management system combined with secure storage and lock-up procedures will result in far less loss due to employee theft.
