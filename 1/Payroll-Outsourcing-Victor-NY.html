<p>Looking for a way of speeding up the check out process in your supermarket? Reports, data, work orders, employee management, customer profiles—Lightspeed's retail POS software helps you run your entire business with cloud-based tools that you can use to grow. Bottom Line: While Lightspeed Retail POS's UI can be a bit busy, it does provide all of the basic features needed for a solid point-of-sale (POS) system. A feature that every retail business owner loves from their POS systems is the reporting feature.</p>
<p>Check inventory on the fly, assist customers with purchase decisions, and complete transactions — at the counter or out on the sales floor. Square charges a minimal percentage for every tap, dip, or swipe (representing your customer's payment via credit card or mobile device) in your POS device (tablet or smartphone with Square magstripe reader or POS terminal with Square contactless reader). The potential for huge profits, additional sales and repeat customers are the overwhelming reasons to sell gift cards.</p>
<p>This type of software can be easily installed on your POS terminal or tablet and has a wide range of capabilities - a notable one being the ability for you to store and view your sales data online. Remember that, like most other business solutions, a POS system should be able to reliably and efficiently address your retail business requirements. Apart from order management, restaurant table management, payment handling, inventory management, employee management, and menu management, it comes with CRM capabilities- all of which we've repeatedly tried, tested and confirmed that they indeed perform well.</p>

It's also easy to open and close tabs for customers by simply swiping their credit card through the system.</p>
<p>Elements of customer experience range from baseline solid replenishment so customers get the products they want, all the way to the heights of experiential retail where they get to test your products in the store - and you can use Retail Pro capabilities to improve each phase. Some point of sale systems come standard with an employee time clock feature that is designed specifically for restaurants and the goofy requirements placed upon restaurant owners.</p>
