<p>POS is now commonly referred to as only the cash register feature within a retail management system. Safe, secure and fast payments: EPOS systems often come equipped with card machines, meaning payments are safe and secure.

<p>That is because these other business types will especially require an appointment calendar and may need retail functionality with inventory control, and not every software program has those features. Analyzing transaction data as a whole, like what customers purchase from you, when and how often, can be more useful for your longer-term marketing efforts, to better segment your shoppers and create personalized email offers based on their purchase history.</p>
<p>Basic point of sale systems currently in use include standalone electronic cash registers, also known as ECRs; ECR-based network systems; and controller-based systems.
