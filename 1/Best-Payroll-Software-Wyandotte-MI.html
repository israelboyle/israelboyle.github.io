CAKE, from Sysco, built its POS to meet the demands of Quick & Full Service restaurants. Point of Sale software for restaurant provides with a secure and reliable restaurant solution. As a result, you should be able to easily manage and coordinate table service, customer orders, as well as table reservations. Multiple happy hour features, create customer tabs, pre-authorize credit cards, and employee management.

A point of sale (POS) is a combination of software and hardware that a business owner needs to run transactions. However, what sets Square apart from most POS systems is that it comes with stellar hardware and software options that are completely free.</p>
<p>Retailer Lyn Evans created that kind of no-disappointment experience for their customers.

<p>Business Intelligence tools are used to retrieve this huge amount of data from different systems and give the end user an opportunity for analysis.
