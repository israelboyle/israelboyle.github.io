<p>When choosing the right retail point-of-sale system (POS) for your business, it is essential to understand what type of system will best meet your needs. Empower your stores to play a new, expanded role in today's omnichannel reality and dramatically simplify your IT infrastructure requirements with Openbravo web and cloud-based retail POS system.
