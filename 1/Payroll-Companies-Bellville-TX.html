<p>Point of sale (POS) can be referred to as a check-out or cash wrap and is usually the location in a store or restaurant where transactions for the exchange goods and services occur. Some point of sale vendors refer to their POS system as "retail management system" which is actually a more appropriate term given that this software is no longer just about processing sales but comes with many other capabilities such as inventory management, membership system, supplier record, bookkeeping, issuing of purchase orders, quotations and stock transfers, hide barcode label creation, sale reporting and in some cases remote outlets networking or linkage, to name some major ones.</p>
<p>It used to be that as a small-business owner, you had just a few ways to accept payments from your customers. Recently purchased by Upserve, the low-cost, user-friendly Upserve caters to bars, clubs, and restaurants. The POS hardware includes an internet-enabled device that can run the POS software, plus transaction tools like a receipt printer and a cash drawer. Brick and mortar retailers are moving toward leaner systems that operate on tablets and smartphones, not complicated systems that cost thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>By bringing IoT-enabled POS system such as wireless systems (for transactions and scanning) to the customer on the sales floor, retailers can boost sales. Ecommerce Platforms is a review site that shows the good, great, bad, and ugly of online store building software. Every restaurant needs the efficiency-enhancing, business-building and security features of a quality point of sale system, but many businesses haven't reached the point where the expense can be justified.</p>

Most POS systems allow you to set reminders when certain inventory stocks are running low.
