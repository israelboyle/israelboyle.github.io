<p>Now the last thing I want is for this be a shameless promotion of the software we develop. One of the first microprocessor-controlled cash register systems was built by William Brobeck and Associates in 1974, for McDonald's Restaurants 4 It used the Intel 8008 , a very early microprocessor (and forerunner to the Intel 8088 processor used in the original IBM Personal Computer ). Each station in the restaurant had its own device which displayed the entire order for a customer — for example, 2 Vanilla Shake, 1 Large Fries, 3 BigMac — using numeric keys and a button for every menu item.</p>
<p>Talech is perfect for restaurants and bars. Salespeople sometimes use it when they track inventory. When you log into the app, you'll notice that the overall interface is simple, intuitive and it provides smart but straightforward tools for managing customer information, generating sales reports, tracking inventory, optimizing staffing, as well as driving customer loyalty. It is easy to install and so simple to deploy that I'm embarrassed to brag about it. Truths when I say the features developed into the application are cutting edge and developed with the latest software methodologies.</p>
<p>We develop fully integrated, end-to-end retail POS and payment solutions in addition to leveraging third-party POS software modules from Poynt, Shopify POS, and QuickBooks POS, among others. It is accessible from every device and comes with tools to let you manage customers, point-of-sale, in-store, omnichannel, omnicommerce, inventory, merchandise, mobile shopping and transactions, CRM, and loyalty programs.</p>

<p>Having these options is mostly a no-brainer these days because you have access to all your sales and programming data online remotely or through an App. That's because many consumers are moving their payment information into virtual credit card apps like Google Pay and Apple Pay.
