<p>Small and mid-size business owners need a Retail POS platform that is capable of managing payment transactions, inventory and purchasing management, pricing, sales and product promotions for single and multi-store locations. Cloud-based POS systems are also created to be compatible with a wide range of POS hardware and sometimes tablets such as Apple's iPad Thus cloud-based POS also helped expand POS systems to mobile devices , such as tablet computers or smartphones 12 These devices can also act as barcode reader s using a built-in camera and as payment terminal s using built-in NFC technology or an external payment card reader.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that it's often more expensive and the hardware is probably going to be unusable if you switch POS software. If you plan to stick with the payment-processing service you are currently using, you should look at POS systems that will work with that system (known as integrated processing‚Äù because the outside company's payments are incorporated into a POS). With a flat and predictable monthly service fee, it's beneficial for merchants who want the lowest TCO (total cost of ownership) of any other full-featured touchscreen point-of-sale systems in the hospitality industry.</p>
<p>Reporting is also a paramount consideration, so when it comes to selecting a retail management software, you'll want customized reporting with detailed customer reporting, sales reports, vendor reporting, and inventory stock levels. POS systems let retailers track their inventory across multiple stores in different locations. The company should have references, provide after-hours technical support, provide warranty protection, assist with incorporating the system in the business, and are up-to-date on software and new features.</p>

<p>The point is to start with a checklist for evaluating restaurant POS systems.
