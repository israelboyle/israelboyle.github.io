Receive and adjust your inventory items each time you get more items in stock to keep your retail store's inventory levels, and your costs, accurate.

<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity.

<p>Instead of using traditional punch cards, you can now track your customer loyalty incentives using the POS system. Before the POS was introduced, businesses used old-school cash tills or registers to manually process transactions. A point of sale (POS) is a place where a customer executes the payment for goods or services and where sales taxes may become payable. It is also seen as the preferred deployment method of many businesses owing to the low price tags that come with cloud-based tools And then there is the projected increase in the use of self-service kiosks, not only by restaurants but among retailers as well.</p>
