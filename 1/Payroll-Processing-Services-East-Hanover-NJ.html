Order management: Process customer orders and generate bills digitally, making it easier to track sales and catch mistakes.

<p>Keep all the stores linked up by sharing customers, gift cards, stock and more. You need to make sure that the POS hardware - the scanners, computers, and printers - is compatible with the software you have chosen. POS hardware can be a stationary terminal or a mobile device, such as a tablet or iPad. For the cash register, the POS terminal is a computerized replacement that helps in processing credit and debit cards.</p>
