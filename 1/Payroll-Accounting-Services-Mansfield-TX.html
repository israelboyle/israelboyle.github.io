<p>In running a successful business, there are few things more important than money. A point of sale system also can manage inventory levels across multiple business locations, allowing you to centralize your tracking system rather than relying on separate inventory schedules for each location. Tracking inventory accurately is a particularly tough challenge for restaurants and bars because the majority of your products aren't in simple units. The menus are outfitted with desirable features that allow guests to place orders, enter custom cooking specifications, order drinks, request table service, tender secure payment (from the table) and view detailed descriptions of menu items-inclusive of high-resolution images and wine and beer pairing options.</p>
<p>Today, smartphones, cloud computing, and RFID technology enable even the smallest businesses to become point-of-sale (POS) wizards. Regardless whether taking orders over the phone or in person, the pizza POS software should guide the staff from greeting the customer through detailed order recording, through any up sells, and to the payment information, and finally the order fulfillment. The buyers guide to POS (Point of Sale) software provides in-depth information to the business people and can help them in choosing the appropriate point of sale system for their industry.</p>

<p>Manage the tables across your restaurant to monitor which tables are occupied, which are not and how many customers are seated at each table.

With this feature, if your business receives a reminder to refill a stock of inventory, you'll simply have to press a few buttons within your POS to do so.
