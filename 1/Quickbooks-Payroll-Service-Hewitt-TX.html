<p>All retail businesses need to use cash registers but more and more high street shops and stores are now turning away from the traditional designs and are switching to POS or, to give them their full name, Point Of Sale machines. We are offering this all-in-one restaurant system which includes the pos, printer, cash drawer, pole display and also barcode scanner together with jRestaurant POS. For merchants, unattended POS systems offer an effective strategy for managing rising labor costs, as they allow one cashier to monitor customers using multiple self-serve POS kiosks instead of ringing up orders at a single station. These systems are best suited for small businesses and entrepreneurs, small retail stores, pop-up shops, and quick-serve establishments.</p>

<p>Mobile POS systems are gaining popularity in some customer-facing industries. While the chances of a disaster, theft, or malfunction happening to those hard drives seems slim; it has hit businesses at the worst times. Once you've come up with a shortlist of potential POS systems, check out what businesses like yours are saying about them. The OrderUp Self-Order Kiosk app is designed to increase ticket size by at least 20% at table and counter service restaurants.</p>

<h3>Accounting Services Company & Business Solutions Hewitt Texas</h3>
<p>You may, for example, not need a cash drawer if the majority of sales are through card. Mobile POS systems allow employees to mingle with your customers on the store floor, deterring shoplifting. For example, you could ask customers questions such as "do you ever shop with us online?" or "would you be interested in a frequent shopper program?" Also, keep in mind that even if there are software packages designed specifically for your type of business, they may vary wildly and you still need to research the features to determine what'll work best for your business.</p>
<p>See what's selling and what's not with detailed sales and inventory reports. Save time by integrating Kounta with your payment terminal, accounting software, staffing tools, loyalty programs, and more.

Like most of the leading bars and restaurants, you probably allow your customers to tip their servers.</p>
<p>The system features a customizable item library, sales reporting, staff management, business analytics and pricing options to fit businesses of all sizes. Employee management: Employees can clock in, process payments, and enter product and customer information with these features.

<p>Instead of the restaurant or bar owner paying the sales tax the customer is now paying the sales tax. Retailers must understand their best customers and architect an operation that attracts them and establishes a meaningful relationship between them and the brand. With custom menu programming, your restaurant POS system will be ready to use the day it arrives. Flexible menu management lets you set automatic happy hour pricing, quickly add new drinks, and easily remove drinks from the menu when inventory for that item is low.</p>
<p>Choosing retail POS software that is cloud-based, as opposed to a local server-based, can save you money too. A cookie is a small piece of data that a website stores on the visitor's computer or mobile device. Retail stores require different types of POS equipment. You may only need a simple system to complete business transactions, or you may require a full-service option that also monitors inventory, tracks employee tips and integrates with other applications.</p>

Track each employee's sales performance and make informed business decisions. This POS system boasts special features for retailers operating hardware stores, pharmacies and boutiques.
