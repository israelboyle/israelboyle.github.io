Double check that the POS is able to accept chip-enabled credit and debit cards. Now whether you refer to it as a POS system or retail management system - it will do the same. And with our custom-made software, you can make sure you offer your customers the best service and gain additional customer loyalty points. While some systems can handle the POS of both restaurants and retail businesses, many systems are designed specifically to handle the demanding needs of the latter.</p>

The potential for huge profits, additional sales and repeat customers are the overwhelming reasons to sell gift cards.</p>
<p>Such terminals are supported with various hardware components; cash registers, age verifiers, kitchen printers, barcode scanners, kitchen buzzers, and more. Springboard is a powerful, cloud-based POS software and management system for retailers.
