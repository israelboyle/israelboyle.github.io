<p>In running a successful business, there are few things more important than money. A point of sale system also can manage inventory levels across multiple business locations, allowing you to centralize your tracking system rather than relying on separate inventory schedules for each location. Tracking inventory accurately is a particularly tough challenge for restaurants and bars because the majority of your products aren't in simple units. The menus are outfitted with desirable features that allow guests to place orders, enter custom cooking specifications, order drinks, request table service, tender secure payment (from the table) and view detailed descriptions of menu items-inclusive of high-resolution images and wine and beer pairing options.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that it's often more expensive and the hardware is probably going to be unusable if you switch POS software. If you plan to stick with the payment-processing service you are currently using, you should look at POS systems that will work with that system (known as integrated processing” because the outside company's payments are incorporated into a POS). With a flat and predictable monthly service fee, it's beneficial for merchants who want the lowest TCO (total cost of ownership) of any other full-featured touchscreen point-of-sale systems in the hospitality industry.</p>
<p>Our POS solutions cover both in-store and online sales. ShopKeep promises business owners the lowest possible integrated payment processing rate so you can save on every transaction. For about $4,000, you can get a traditional bar POS system which includes a touchscreen monitor with a built-in PC, a credit card reader, a cash drawer, a receipt printer, and all the cabling required. Table service and fly-by service order entry, cashier financial accountability, and staff communications.</p>
<h2>Payment Systems Explained Bumpass</h2>
<p>Retail 4.0 stores such as Amazon Go would shift point-of-sale purchases to e-commerce wherein customers would be making transactions with their smartphones instead of swiping cards. Enterprise & Mobile Reporting: From inventory status to sales forecasting, you can stay abreast of daily success metrics for your restaurant with this restaurant management software. The TouchBistro hybrid POS system for restaurants requires you to first set up a local network before proceeding to install the software.</p>
<p>The module provides reports that save you time and enable you to gain the insights you need to make data-driven business decisions. RFID in POS can further allow for charging to a customer's card via smartphone before they leave the store. The SalesVu team will help you configure your kiosks and make your menu even more irresistible by adding enticing photos and tempt customers with up-selling and cross-selling prompts that encourage them to spend more.</p>

<p>So, your staff at the restaurant, travel desk or any other POS outlet is always updated with the right information in real-time. Bars have unique business models, and they need POS systems that can accommodate those unique needs. For credit card processing, businesses can choose ShopKeep Payments or any processor in the BridgePay gateway including First Data, Chase Paymentech, Vantiv and Heartland. You also need magnetic stripe readers to process credit card payments.</p>
<p>The number one reason customers get unhappy with a retail store is a long queue at the check-out. There are so many restaurants out there who offer the home delivery feature for their customers. Square POS also sells Square Stand, an iPad contactless and chip stand that allows contactless payments as well as chip cards, NFC and magstripe. A feature-rich POS software provides a huge range of capabilities such as billing and order processing, sales monitoring and reporting, inventory tracking, returns, analytics, mobile connectivity, customer data management, employee management, and loyalty programs.</p>
<p>Business Intelligence tools are used to retrieve this huge amount of data from different systems and give the end user an opportunity for analysis. The primary reason you need a point of sale for a restaurant is to accept cash and credit card payments. Multiple configurations as per the store requirement - I will explain with a simple example, say a retail chain wants to run a promotional offer only in one particular city, in such case, special configurations are required to be done for POS systems running in that city.</p>
<p>It's important to remember that not all restaurant POS systems are one-size-fits-all solutions. Its mobile implementation is equally capable with a one-touch payment feature to support a responsive build and superior micro-moments technology to drive your brand and actual growth of sales. Avoid long lines with Shopify POS by accepting payments from anywhere in the store. Many POS providers also offer multiple software plans, with higher cost plans leading to lower payment processing fees.</p>
