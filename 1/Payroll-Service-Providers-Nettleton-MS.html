Therefore, buying the POS hardware is the right decision, even if you comprise a few features to cut down the initial cost. The ShopKeep Restaurant POS system generates solid insights, which come handy when you're making critical business decisions.</p>
<p>It is hard to find a mechanical cash register today; the majority of POS systems are electronic, meaning they use an electronic cash register or computer system. When customers call a restaurant to order take-out or delivery, they want the experience to be as quick and painless as possible — from phone call to receipt of their order. All reports about the bills, orders, sales, customers, etc. Increase sales and profit, by serving your customers faster and avoid common mistakes that happen in the point of sale checkout lane.</p>

<p>Improved efficiency means higher customer satisfaction, lower costs and higher sales. Understand what items you should keep on your menu, how many sales come from your new promotions, how your new bartender performs, and more. But like retail sales training, don't see the purchase as a cost but as an investment. It provides recipe management and food costing, purchase management, stock management and inventory, along with a powerful reporting capability.</p>
<p>This high-end system helps restaurants improve and grow their business. In addition to monthly software costs, the hardware costs are a one-time fixed cost that starts at $799. With its recipe management, you can set ingredients as you see fit and instantly see the effects of each change on the cost of your menu items.
