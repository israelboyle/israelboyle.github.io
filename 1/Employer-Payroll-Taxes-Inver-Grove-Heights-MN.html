<p>Now the last thing I want is for this be a shameless promotion of the software we develop. One of the first microprocessor-controlled cash register systems was built by William Brobeck and Associates in 1974, for McDonald's Restaurants 4 It used the Intel 8008 , a very early microprocessor (and forerunner to the Intel 8088 processor used in the original IBM Personal Computer ). Each station in the restaurant had its own device which displayed the entire order for a customer — for example, 2 Vanilla Shake, 1 Large Fries, 3 BigMac — using numeric keys and a button for every menu item.</p>
<p>Other Rezku features include integrated time clock, tableside ordering and payments, cash drawer, kitchen display system, and more. Aside from the POS software and hardware that handle transactions, payment processing, and inventory, other main features include staff management, CRM, reporting and analytics, and integrations.

<p>Shopkeep software increases sales and provides your customers the convenience to pay using several ways.

Cova has a powerful reporting feature that provides detailed insights, including unusual cannabis sales or inventory patterns. At a basic level POS software manages the transaction calculations.</p>
<p>Another fast-growing standard is the near-field communications (NFC) transaction, which is an electronic payment system being popularized by mobile giants such as Apple Pay and Google Wallet Making sure your POS system candidate can handle these new emerging systems is only half of the equation. But most importantly, POS software has been helping customers by accelerating the sales process and contributing to customer experience, whose benefits go both ways.</p>
