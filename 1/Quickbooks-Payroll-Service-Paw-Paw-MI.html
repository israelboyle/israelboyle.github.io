<p>All retail businesses need to use cash registers but more and more high street shops and stores are now turning away from the traditional designs and are switching to POS or, to give them their full name, Point Of Sale machines. We are offering this all-in-one restaurant system which includes the pos, printer, cash drawer, pole display and also barcode scanner together with jRestaurant POS. For merchants, unattended POS systems offer an effective strategy for managing rising labor costs, as they allow one cashier to monitor customers using multiple self-serve POS kiosks instead of ringing up orders at a single station. These systems are best suited for small businesses and entrepreneurs, small retail stores, pop-up shops, and quick-serve establishments.</p>
<p>These portable systems give you the flexibility to process payments right at the point of sale instead of making customers wait in line. If delivery is a significant portion of your business, you'll need a restaurant POS system that specializes in delivery management. A point of sale (POS) is a combination of software and hardware that a business owner needs to run transactions. However, what sets Square apart from most POS systems is that it comes with stellar hardware and software options that are completely free.</p>
<p>Right off the bat, the name Square for Restaurants ” should tell you three things about this POS solution. IVend POS helps retailers reward customer value across all channels with integrated store and online loyalty, allowing shoppers to accrue and redeem points in any channel. TouchBistro is one of the most used and popular iPad-based POS systems, which caters to both quick service and full-service establishments of any size.</p>

<p>POS systems come with a wide variety of features and add-ons. One thing you should note though- while you comfortable adopt it in a single-location business, TouchBistro's POS system is predominantly ideal for restaurant businesses with multiple locations. However, varying POS locations can give retailers more opportunities to micro-market specific product categories and influence consumers at earlier points in the sales funnel.</p>
<p>As you can see, some basic hardware and software features are common to both QSR and FSR point of sale systems. Although you should consider your business's unique POS system needs, we think Square offers the best overall package to fit most small businesses, from restaurants to retail shops. Recent research, Retail in 4 Dimensions , shows 60 percent of consumers surveyed want mobile payment options in-store.</p>
