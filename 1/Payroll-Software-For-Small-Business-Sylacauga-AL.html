<p>It's hard to envision a retail or point of sale (POS) environment that doesn't make use of touch technology. Manhattan Point of Sale is the next generation POS system for retail, helping retailers sell, fulfill, and engage anywhere. Bar menus change all the time, and your point of sale system should adapt to it. Whether you offer happy hour specials or a new food item on your menu, you want a system that can sync all the information. It is used to store Money, credit card receipts and other paperwork. The primary differences between Quick Service and Full Service POS systems can be found in the software and hardware specifications.</p>
<p>Other Rezku features include integrated time clock, tableside ordering and payments, cash drawer, kitchen display system, and more. Aside from the POS software and hardware that handle transactions, payment processing, and inventory, other main features include staff management, CRM, reporting and analytics, and integrations. In the hospitality field, this date recorded by POS systems can be used to track what customers need, are lacking, or is profitable and what is not.</p>
<p>A traditional retail store monitors and tracks inventory and sales as merchandise is scanned and sold at the cash register. Then this information is sent to the software in the main system, which matches information from the bar code with information in the database listing the inventory. It integrates with POS systems and streamlines taking and analyzing your beverage inventory. Essentially, though, the cost of a POS can be broken out into the expense of hardware and software, and the cost of processing payments.</p>

<p>Credit card reader: Since the EMV payment standard went live in 2015 , secure and EMV-compliant credit card readers are a must-have. Also, you'll want to train your staff on important features like upselling, inventory management, and end of day reports, all from the POS itself. Mobile technology has untethered the payment process from the traditional register, turning the entire store into a POS via tablets and other devices.</p>

While each of those establishments are classified as restaurants, they all have very different demands when it comes to choosing the right POS system for their specific needs.</p>
<p>Inventory Management: Having a POS system that specifically helps you manage your retail inventory can be a lifesaver Some of these features can include purchase order management, low stock alerts, and the ability to transfer stock across multiple stores to name a few. The POS unit handles the sales to the consumer but it is only one part of the entire POS system used in a retail business. The restaurants can generate 15 to 20 bills in a minute's time, ensuring quicker settlements.</p>
<p>But if you're looking for deeper insights into details like profits, labor costs, and historical comparisons, look for retail POS systems that offer advanced real-time reporting. The first one is an online type of system that is connected to a central computer for credit checking and inventory updating.
