<p>Point of sale or POS systems are a necessary and invaluable part of most businesses. Restaurants need the ability to securely sell, track and redeem gift card transactions without transaction fees. For example, some restaurants require that items selected by the customers be attended to and can only be placed by the waiter who has the password required to do so. This prevents fake orders - such as may be entered by playful kids - and subsequent dispute on the items ordered. Collecting information even before your guests walk in your restaurant will keep you better prepared for your staff pre-service.</p>
<p>Restaurant Point of Sale Systems do much more than the typical Restaurant POS Cash Register. With a handheld mPOS your customers do not need to line up and wait at the counter when they have to place an order. The customers were required to go to the cash register where their credit cards could be processed. A typical EPoS system in not capable of being all things to all men, so it's essential that it has the capacity to be integrated into other systems within the business.</p>
<p>For example, department stores often have POSs for individual product groups, such as appliances, electronics, and apparel. The speed at which point of sale (POS) software is evolving is significant. If you need internal security, manage data access with employee passcodes for checking individual sales and refunds. When choosing the best POS system for your bar, it is important to factor in the features you need and your available budget.</p>

<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity.
