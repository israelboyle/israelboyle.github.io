<p>A cashier scanning bar coded merchandise at the check-out point of any retail store is a very familiar and expected occurrence. A POS System is the actual software and hardware you use to manage your business. This is ideal for restaurants where customers order at the counter, freeing up cashiers to help prepare orders faster. QuickBooks allows you to track sales, customers, and inventory quickly and easily through three versions: Basic, Pro and Multi-Store. If you go with a restaurant POS vendor that doesn't offer installation and training, it'll be on you to both install and train your staff.</p>
<p>Different types of restaurants have different software needs, so when choosing your POS system you must first start by considering the type of food service you are running and then matching it up with the system that will be most productive for you and your business. As you can see, there are many options and features to consider when it comes to retail POS technology. With an integration to your onsite property management system from the POS, you can charge restaurant checks directly to the room for billing.</p>
<p>Lightspeed handles most bar sales and management needs seamlessly.
