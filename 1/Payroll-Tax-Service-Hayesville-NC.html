<p>Like their printer counterpart an all-in-one POS system combines multiple technologies and integrates them into one housing to maximize value plus convenience to the end user. Your point of sale system should be able to manage your customer base, keep up with their buying habits, how often they visit, when was their last visit and what special occasions they have coming up. Your point of sale system then should be able to sort these into groups that should be sent mailers, coupons, invitations to special events or simply told that they are appreciated and asked to visit you again.</p>
<p>The hardware of a POS system consists of the physical setup like cash register connected to a PC or server, or even a portable device such as a tablet or smartphone connected to a cloud-hosted system. The TouchBistro hardware setup is simple and low cost and the licensing fees are also cheap compared to the gigantic POS systems of yore. Hardware investments are minimal, and the system is cheaper to set up than most traditional bar POS systems because it is compatible with third-party POS equipment.</p>

They will even give your management team, your staff, or your customers endless access to their learning center. Online Ordering - Apart from reservations, your restaurant POS system should provide customers with an intuitive portal for placing their orders online.</p>

<p>Business Intelligence tools are used to retrieve this huge amount of data from different systems and give the end user an opportunity for analysis.

The many benefits of point of sale systems make it an essential business investment.</p>
<p>Prominent features include omnichannel delivery, integrated POS, cost control, kiosks, and yes, even kitchen management. As an example, for a small business with one POS machine, we estimate you'll pay around $1,250 for hardware and about $69 per month for a software subscription. While the word inventory may instill fear in many managers, most admit, it directly affects a restaurant making money. Repeat customers are the lifeblood of any retail business.</p>
