The POS hardware costs include tablets, monitors, card readers, receipt printers, barcode scanners, and self- service kiosks. As long as you don't need to run any in-person transactions, a point of sale system that works online—with customers inputting their card info in order to pay for your business's product or services—could be all you need.</p>
