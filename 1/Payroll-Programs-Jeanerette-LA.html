Connect your store with multiple inventory source to manage multi-channel inventories from a single website and easily track your product stock in a particular inventory.</p>
<p>Lightspeed is a cloud-based Point of Sales (POS) and eCommerce solution. POS software designed specifically for retailers won't necessarily support the needs of a business in the foodservice and restaurant industry. Also, you'll want to have online access to see your labor costs and sales reports. Opt for the Revel Advantage plan, and payments can be processed for a flat fee through Revel for an EMV-ready, Apple Pay-ready, all-cards-accepted service.</p>
<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity. At the same time, a good POS system will allow you to accept cash, credit, and contactless payments and some will even let you accept online payments for your products and services.</p>
