<p>Retail Pro was already localized for Latin America and already had an integration to SAP so we were able to open our new stores in only 60 days. Your Striven POS solution is a power feature rich platform, offering hardware retailers with one or 100 stores the most power industry designed solution on the market today. A supermarket with high traffic cannot afford a systemic failure, hence each point of sale station should not only be very robust both in terms of software, database and hardware specifications but also designed in such a way as to prevent causing a systemic failure - such as may happen through the use of a single central database for operations.</p>
<p>In response, retailers pursuing omnichannel with Retail Pro are turning their technology gains into customer-facing conveniences for unified commerce that puts shoppers first. The Basic plan gives you a few more in-store features, but it is the Shopify and Advanced Shopify that really gives you enough to run a serious brick and mortar store - with an online Shopify store.

<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity. At the same time, a good POS system will allow you to accept cash, credit, and contactless payments and some will even let you accept online payments for your products and services.</p>
<p>Small businesses will appreciate the savings from turning mobile devices into a POS without the need for extra hardware. It appears from such software reviews that enterprise-level cloud-based POS systems are currently lacking in the market. Finding the company that charges the least for credit card transactions is key, but you may also need a system that can accept cash or be willing to take your business cashless.</p>
