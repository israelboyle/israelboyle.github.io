<p>The technology of EPoS or Electronic Point of Sale, has modernized the entire hospitality industry by making its transactions more swift and 100% accurate. Financial Statements: Finally, one of the most important features of a restaurant POS system. Restaurant-specific features include ingredient inventory tracking, table layouts, tableside and online ordering, franchise management, catering and delivery.
