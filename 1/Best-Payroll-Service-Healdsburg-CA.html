But if you've done any online searches for POS systems yourself, you've likely discovered something overwhelming: there's a staggering pile of POS solutions to choose from.

Looking up slow or busy times and profitable sales by brand or supplier is easy with graphical reporting. There are two types of point of sale systems, Web-Based and Native POS.</p>
<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity. At the same time, a good POS system will allow you to accept cash, credit, and contactless payments and some will even let you accept online payments for your products and services.</p>
<p>It has been proven that businesses that do not accept credit cards for purchases will have at least 60% less sales than similar business that accept credit cards.
