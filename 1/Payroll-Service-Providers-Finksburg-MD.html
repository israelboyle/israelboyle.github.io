<p>A point of sale system, or POS, is the place where your customer makes a payment for products or services at your store. There is also a table management module, a sales reports module, and other features like top-tracking.

<p>With our mobile card reader, you can start taking card, contactless and device payments.

Live stock by line has been a huge transformation for a company operating in several locations, meaning that regardless of location, all stores are selling items at the correct price as well as having the ability to sell from another location so as to secure the customer purchase.</p>

SWIM offers four different pricing structures, starting with a month of trialling the software to the highest plan that includes unlimited sales and inventory items. Customers prefer high profile retail stores over vendors to escape the discomfort involved in street shopping. The solution is designed for the needs of different types of retailers, allowing centralized purchasing to save time by ordering from integrated catalogs.</p>
<p>EMV payments are processed by dipping a credit card into a slot in the card reader and allowing it to read the microchip.
