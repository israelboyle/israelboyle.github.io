<p>Updating your point of sale (POS) systems can help you to provide better customer service, increase your stock control, increase staff efficiency, reduce theft at the point of sale, and provide customers with more information. The ShopKeep Restaurant POS system has a solid customer information system, which comes in handy when you need to maintain conversations with your customers, as well as promote the business through loyalty programs like gift cards. Infor POS helps operators in hotels, food services, restaurants, and other hospitality organizations control incoming data from multiple revenue centers. Over the last few months they have shifted their company from a small business to a corporation that does not care about their individual customers.</p>
<p>Restaurant Software -FusionResto software lets you manage & run your restaurant business more efficiently through intuitive features. Tableside service helps restaurants reduce or fully eliminate the constant travel by servers between tables and a terminal. Apart from inventory management, you should be able to coordinate customer orders, process payments, track all the restaurant elements, as well as manage your staff right from the point of sale system.</p>
<p>With the launch of mobile payment particularly Android Pay and Apple Pay both in 2015, it is expected that because of its greater convenience coupled with good security features, this would eventually eclipse other types of payment services - including the use of payment terminals. Since 1990, we have aimed to give restaurants a competitive edge by providing simple, yet powerful restaurant management solutions, designed specifically for the industry.</p>

<p>At the till, on the shop floor, at a special event or in the field - Infinity POS software works at any fixed or mobile location, bringing salespeople to customers anywhere. The restaurant POS software does not work well with the retailer's needs. Customers have special requests all the time. DW systems get updated from the data that comes from the POS systems. Shopify POS and Intuit QuickBooks Point of Sale charge monthly subscription fees for the use of their software along with an additional fee for payment processing.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of companies that exist only to provide their bar and restaurant software to you. TouchBistro restaurant POS system doesn't come with purchase-ordering and vendor management capabilities. This simplifies the payment process for both customers and establishments. Another fast-growing standard is the near-field communications (NFC) transaction, which is an electronic payment system being popularized by mobile giants such as Apple Pay and Google Wallet ( at Google Pay) Making sure your POS system candidate can handle these new emerging systems is only half of the equation.</p>

Keeping customers happy is made possible by a customer profiling tool which lets you create the best rewards and incentives for returning customers and new conversions. They will also track your employees, inventory, and customers.</p>
<p>Scheduling employees and staying on top of their hours is possible from the POS too, and our POS can be integrated with your payroll management software. Most restaurant owners would agree that it's worth paying a little more each month in order to ensure that: 1) you and your staff can get support when you need it 2) you'll always have the most up-to-date software available. These features can also help manage those customers and page them when work has been completed.</p>
<p>And many POS systems are capable of accepting almost any type of payment, including contactless payments like Apple Pay and Google Pay.

An effective inventory management system combined with secure storage and lock-up procedures will result in far less loss due to employee theft. The most common feedback KORONA gets from new customers is that they have never used a retail point of sale system that is faster.</p>

<p>Vend can be used with any credit card processor that offers an payment gateway (which is most of them). Clover is capable of processing both debit and credit card payments and those made through Apple Pay. Modern point-of-sale (POS) systems are no longer limited to cash registers due in part to new technologies such as the cloud and mobile devices.
