<p>The time and attendance system is another crucial aspect of managing labor. The Lavu restaurant POS system can proceed with payment processing even in offline mode. But the POS has transformed physical retail, allowing SMBs and large corporations alike to gain new, deep insights into their business. This is why I recommend taking your time and assessing the various people you will rely on to make the software work for your business. Evolving from the bulky, complex cash register system to today's highly-portable, fits-in-your-pocket card readers, accepting payments has never been simpler.</p>
<p>We culled seven of the best POS systems depending on a restaurant's particular needs. Our POS software enables restaurateurs to improve the profitability of their business through faster and more accurate order processing, multiple integrated modules like customer interface, employee interface, and access to 100+ reports. Another benefit of cash: there are no associated credit card fees.

It can make a real difference to how much time you spend on processing sales, replenishing stock and even training your staff. The software in some systems runs only for a limited period of time. With POS software, restaurant managers and owners can meet many of their practical business needs, from managing daily service all the way up to high-level analytics.</p>
