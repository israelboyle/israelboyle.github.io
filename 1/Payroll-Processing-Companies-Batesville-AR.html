<p>Selecting the best retail point of sale (POS) system is not something to take lightly. Hardware: This includes routers, terminals, kiosks, handheld devices, card readers, kitchen display systems, printers, and guest-facing display. Our projects range from single-purpose tasks for small businesses to highly complex, multi-platform systems for large corporate clients. Provides an invaluable tool that allows you to not only process purchases but integrates inventory, customer info, returns, exchanges, credit card processing, rewards programs, sales, records, etc all on one machine.</p>

All in all, Lightspeed is considered a relatively simple POS system for restaurants. The real-time analytic sales data tool helps you make the right marketing decisions for your business. The system will allow the bartender(s) in your business to spend less time on the POS screen.</p>
<p>A traditional retail store monitors and tracks inventory and sales as merchandise is scanned and sold at the cash register. Then this information is sent to the software in the main system, which matches information from the bar code with information in the database listing the inventory. It integrates with POS systems and streamlines taking and analyzing your beverage inventory. Essentially, though, the cost of a POS can be broken out into the expense of hardware and software, and the cost of processing payments.</p>
