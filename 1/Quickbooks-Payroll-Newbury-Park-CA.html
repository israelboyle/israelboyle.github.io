<p>The bottom line: A good restaurant POS centralizes all the processes of a restaurant, bar or cafe, allowing the manager to improve on what's working and fix what's not. As retailers adopt new POS strategies, they will generate a wealth of data that will yield new insights into customer behaviour, inventory, pricing, sales trends and more. Top-rated restaurant POS systems also offer preset tipping options, built-in distribution, and server payout calculators.</p>
<p>The software provides inventory management to eliminate the need for manual stock tracking and management, which could cost you more hours doing mundane tasks than growing your revenue and customer base. You can analyze customer history data in Retail Pro to personalize your marketing with recommendations based on items they recently or frequently purchased. With many top-tier point of sale systems, your employees will be able to clock in and clock out through the POS.</p>
<p>On-Premise - There are broad ranges of features in on-premise modules, and it is difficult and time-consuming to add new functionalities in this POS solution.
