<p>The early days of using a cash register and pen and notebook for accounting and processing transactions are no longer an effective means of keeping up with today's advancements in business technology. On the subject of transactions, Vend gives your customers the option of putting their favorite items on layaway or to pay for their goods via a split payment or credit they've accumulated on their customer account. Flexibility - At this point, many POS transactions are card-based, not cash-based. All in all, offering NFC, EMV, and magstripe payments guarantees you will be able to accommodate your customers no matter their payment method.</p>

Mobile Point of Sale - If the users do not manage a lot of inventory and prefer to be mobile, then Smartphone POS services is an apt option for processing payments.</p>
