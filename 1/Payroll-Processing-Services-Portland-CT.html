A POS System is the actual software and hardware you use to manage your business. This is ideal for restaurants where customers order at the counter, freeing up cashiers to help prepare orders faster. QuickBooks allows you to track sales, customers, and inventory quickly and easily through three versions: Basic, Pro and Multi-Store. If you go with a restaurant POS vendor that doesn't offer installation and training, it'll be on you to both install and train your staff.</p>

Founded in 2004 in France, CLYO Systems creates payment and management solutions for restaurants, bars and cafés.</p>
<p>Despite the cash register motif, however, when people talk about POS systems, they're mostly referring to the software, which could be client-based or cloud-based.
