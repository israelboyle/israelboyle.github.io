Infor POS helps operators in hotels, food services, restaurants, and other hospitality organizations control incoming data from multiple revenue centers. Over the last few months they have shifted their company from a small business to a corporation that does not care about their individual customers.</p>
<p>However, customers tend to abandon their cards if the balances get below a certain amount.

<p>Manage the tables across your restaurant to monitor which tables are occupied, which are not and how many customers are seated at each table. If you are planning a very small operation, such as bagel or sandwich shop, you may not need a POS system at the opening time, especially if you aren't going to take credit cards (and there are plenty of places that still don't accept plastic). With this feature, if your business receives a reminder to refill a stock of inventory, you'll simply have to press a few buttons within your POS to do so. Keep in mind that first you'll have to onboard your vendors into your POS system.</p>
<p>Before choosing one, you need to consider the numbers of departments and terminals, the work-load, the modes of payments, the type of computer operating system and database, whether accessible online or not, the hardware part of the system etc. National Retail Solutions' POS+ system is designed for small, independent retail stores. The days of receipt pads and cash registers are sadly gone, and today's most successful restaurants rely on state of the art POS systems to increase their profit margins and keep their account books in the black.</p>
