With this feature, if your business receives a reminder to refill a stock of inventory, you'll simply have to press a few buttons within your POS to do so. Keep in mind that first you'll have to onboard your vendors into your POS system.</p>
<p>Before choosing one, you need to consider the numbers of departments and terminals, the work-load, the modes of payments, the type of computer operating system and database, whether accessible online or not, the hardware part of the system etc. National Retail Solutions' POS+ system is designed for small, independent retail stores.
