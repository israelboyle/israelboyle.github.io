<p>Choosing a POS, or point of sale, system seems as though it would be quite easy. For instance, while a restaurant is typically concerned about how the sale window functions, whether it has functionality such as for creating item buttons, for various discounts, for adding a service charge, for holding of receipts, for queuing, for table service as well as for takeaways, merging and splitting of a receipt, these capabilities may yet be insufficient for a spa or slimming center which would require in addition a scheduling window with historical records of customers' attendance and their special requirements.</p>
<p>Bartenders should know how to make any drink order a customer can throw at them, even if it's not on the menu. Choosing a system that uses unlocked POS hardware can save you money because, if you decide to switch systems, you may be able to continue using the unlocked equipment. ShopKeep also offers a countertop POS hardware for the register, card reader and receipt printer. It also has a built-in timeclock and sales reports that show your most popular items, busiest hours, and top employees.</p>
<p>Whether they are standing at the bar or chilling on the terrasse, your customers want the full experience.

The POS hardware costs include tablets, monitors, card readers, receipt printers, barcode scanners, and self- service kiosks. As long as you don't need to run any in-person transactions, a point of sale system that works online—with customers inputting their card info in order to pay for your business's product or services—could be all you need.</p>
<p>That feature is a key for busy restaurants: Toast Go also means servers can run customer credit cards right at the table and have the receipt emailed to them.
