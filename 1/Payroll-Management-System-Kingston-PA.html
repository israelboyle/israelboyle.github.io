<p>A point of sale system, or POS, is the place where your customer makes a payment for products or services at your store. There is also a table management module, a sales reports module, and other features like top-tracking.

<p>The bottom line: A good restaurant POS centralizes all the processes of a restaurant, bar or cafe, allowing the manager to improve on what's working and fix what's not. As retailers adopt new POS strategies, they will generate a wealth of data that will yield new insights into customer behaviour, inventory, pricing, sales trends and more. Top-rated restaurant POS systems also offer preset tipping options, built-in distribution, and server payout calculators.</p>
<p>A single POS terminal may be enough for small and new businesses, but you may want to add more if your business is busy and you need to reduce wait times. As your small business grows, so can your point of sales system. Track their hours, sales performance, overtime hours, and set special permissions for each user. It fulfills all our requirements and fits our budget, way more than I expected from a restaurant POS software.</p>
<p>Instead of using traditional punch cards, you can now track your customer loyalty incentives using the POS system. Before the POS was introduced, businesses used old-school cash tills or registers to manually process transactions. A point of sale (POS) is a place where a customer executes the payment for goods or services and where sales taxes may become payable. It is also seen as the preferred deployment method of many businesses owing to the low price tags that come with cloud-based tools And then there is the projected increase in the use of self-service kiosks, not only by restaurants but among retailers as well.</p>
