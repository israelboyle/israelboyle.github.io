<p>The other consideration, when discussing payment processing and POS systems for bars, is the ability to accept all payment types. A mobile POS system means better, faster customer management processes. Restaurants that bustling with clients have installed this new software to be able to track and complete orders in real time, similar to a rail or airport flight schedule.

<p>Bottom Line: Vend POS is a highly flexible and mobile point-of-sale (POS) system that, while it lacks a few advanced features and charges extra for phone support, is an excellent choice for small businesses. Regardless if you're operating a small shop or a restaurant, you would want automation to be on your side when managing sales transactions. With a good (POS) point of sale system, you'll shape inventory to meet customer needs, and find ways to improve the bottom line.</p>

Real-time reporting — the option to generate real-time business reports, based on product sales and inventory data, is one of the key features that every multi-store retailer needs. Bottom Line: ShopKeep offers the point-of-sale (POS) system features that most small businesses will want without overwhelming them; however, the cost of add-ons can add up.</p>
<p>The company also offers Aldelo Restaurant POS for small and midsize restaurants that prefer a Windows-based POS system. ShopKeep's hardware comprises of iPad enclosures, cash drawers, printers, readers and other robust hardware to cater for the needs of modern businesses. Since it is by default a free shop till system (not including card payment fees), all you do is sign up, download the app, possibly order the card reader, and start using the system.</p>

<p>Again, these exploits by hackers could only be made possible because payment cards were processed through the POS system allowing the malware to either intercept card data during processing or steal and transmit unencrypted card data that is stored in the system database. A POS should have customer relationship management (CRM) to track all customer data. Vend POS checks most of the boxes small businesses are looking for when it comes to a point-of-sale solution.</p>
