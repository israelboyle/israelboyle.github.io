A POS system for your restaurant and bar will help you retain the money you earn. If a restaurant offers gift cards, POS software offers an easy way to redeem them and adjust the check. Then when it comes to payment processing, Square for restaurants proves to be quite a flexible solution. This is a suitable point-of-sale option if you do not manage a lot of inventory and you need to be mobile. Besides, nowadays, most of the barcode scanner may also integrate with Inventory Management system to change stock levels automatically and efficiently.</p>
<p>Many times the systems were confusing, and this meant increased hours spent training staff members on the functionality of the systems. Tracking sales by items, department, and hours, plus costs for food, labor, and other expenses are some important KPIs needed. The Zebra Scanner DS2208 is a two-dimensional barcode scanner that is widely used by retail stores for scanning product barcodes, electronic coupons, and even membership cards.</p>

However, a POS purchase can happen anywhere with the increase in mobile payment terminals. A cloud-based POS system, Lightspeed has a restaurant-specific design that streamlines hospitality functions for the manager and customer.</p>

Also, you'll want to train your staff on important features like upselling, inventory management, and end of day reports, all from the POS itself. Mobile technology has untethered the payment process from the traditional register, turning the entire store into a POS via tablets and other devices.</p>
