<p>Why should you worry about the Point of Sale system you use in your business? Web-based solution that provides restaurant POS through credit card integration, automation, call center and more. You manage your inventory and order at two places and you have to keep an eye on your stock every time a sale is made. You'll also have access to the ShopKeep mobile app, where you can view real-time sales information, inventory, and data from anywhere on the go. This makes it easy for you to keep an eye on your business even when you're not physically present on location.</p>
<p>Interested businesses can give Quickbooks' POS a free trial and pricing is dependent on the hardware and software bundle a business opts for. Many systems let you individually track employee details, shifts, payroll, and more and then send that data to accounting software. Unified technologies are integral in this balance, offering a truer picture of your business and customers so you can discover and act on opportunities to better serve your customers.</p>
<p>Mentioned above is the list of some of the best restaurant management software available for purchase. All of these features help you run your business your way, the way it's meant to be run - plus it keeps your customers happy. POS systems increase security as employees are accountable for their orders, sales, and the drinks they pour. In 2015, EMV became the standard of credit card reader for its high security - making payment cards nearly impossible to copy and reduce the huge possibility of accepting counterfeit cards.</p>

Better still, it wraps up all the needed features into an easy-to-understand interface: Sales, billing, inventory, layout management, analytics reports and loyalty programs are included.</p>
<p>Business Intelligence tools are used to retrieve this huge amount of data from different systems and give the end user an opportunity for analysis. The primary reason you need a point of sale for a restaurant is to accept cash and credit card payments. Multiple configurations as per the store requirement - I will explain with a simple example, say a retail chain wants to run a promotional offer only in one particular city, in such case, special configurations are required to be done for POS systems running in that city.</p>
<p>For complicated functions like employee time tracking and synchronized inventory management, the user can make use of this system. A complete hospitality POS system (choose from cafe, restaurant, or nightclub and bar configurations) with all the hardware you need will run you $1,799. Point of sale systems use computers or specialized terminals that are combined with cash registers, bar code readers, optical scanners and magnetic stripe readers for accurately and instantly capturing the transaction.</p>

<p>Another fast-growing standard is the near-field communications (NFC) transaction, which is an electronic payment system being popularized by mobile giants such as Apple Pay and Google Wallet Making sure your POS system candidate can handle these new emerging systems is only half of the equation.
