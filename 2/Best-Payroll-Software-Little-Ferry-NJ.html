<p>Restaurant POS, or point of sale system, combines software and hardware for centralizing a restaurant's business operations. A POS system for your restaurant and bar will help you retain the money you earn. If a restaurant offers gift cards, POS software offers an easy way to redeem them and adjust the check.
