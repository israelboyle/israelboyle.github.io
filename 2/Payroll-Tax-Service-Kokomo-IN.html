<p>A cashier scanning bar coded merchandise at the check-out point of any retail store is a very familiar and expected occurrence. A POS System is the actual software and hardware you use to manage your business. This is ideal for restaurants where customers order at the counter, freeing up cashiers to help prepare orders faster. QuickBooks allows you to track sales, customers, and inventory quickly and easily through three versions: Basic, Pro and Multi-Store. If you go with a restaurant POS vendor that doesn't offer installation and training, it'll be on you to both install and train your staff.</p>
<p>POS systems still include both software and hardware components, but they now also offer many new functions as well. As the data are instantly available and input into your retail POS accounting back office software, you can now spot trends as they happen, not after they are long gone. Each day restaurants handle large volumes of cash and credit card transactions, making a POS system necessary. In this article, let's take a look at the ten best restaurant management software that are currently quite popular in the market.</p>
