<p>If the sound POS system is connected to the computerized accounting system, then the user can clear credit cards, record transactions manage sales, and collect taxes quickly. On the high end, if you're investing in hardware and software to be used with multiple terminals, you'll need to consider the cost of licensing the product per terminal (upwards of $800-$1200 for a non-Cloud system), the cost of each terminal's credit card software (perhaps another $300-$500 each), and, if you don't have the terminals already, between $2,000-$3,000 per terminal.</p>
<p>Basic point of sale systems currently in use include standalone electronic cash registers, also known as ECRs; ECR-based network systems; and controller-based systems. Cloud-based POS systems are different from traditional POS largely because user data, including sales and inventory, are not stored locally, but in a remote server. The software features advanced caller ID integration to easily manage incoming calls.</p>
<p>Thus should the remote server fail, the cashier can switch over to the local sale window without disrupting sales. Using handheld POS systems, employees can quickly and effortlessly accept orders, process payments, and complete transactions all while interacting with their guests. Setting up Cybersys POS is a straightforward process, with your list of customers, suppliers, or gift cards easily transferred from one store to the next.</p>
