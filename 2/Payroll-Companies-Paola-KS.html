<p>POS software offer's your business many conveniences that you simply can't afford to be without. CAKE is a cost-efficient end-to-end POS, guest management, and online ordering system from Sysco. Is a fully integrated Intuitive Restaurant POS Software suitable to work in restaurants, bars, night clubs and more. NCR Silver aims its point-of-sale solution at both small and larger businesses with hooks to enterprise-class back-ends and a wide variety of hardware options. For example, sending a sale flyer for 30% off on oversized shirts” to the customer who wears a medium sized shirt would be a waste of time.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that it's often more expensive and the hardware is probably going to be unusable if you switch POS software. If you plan to stick with the payment-processing service you are currently using, you should look at POS systems that will work with that system (known as integrated processing” because the outside company's payments are incorporated into a POS). With a flat and predictable monthly service fee, it's beneficial for merchants who want the lowest TCO (total cost of ownership) of any other full-featured touchscreen point-of-sale systems in the hospitality industry.</p>
<p>While some retailers still use systems as described above, many are moving on to advanced cloud-based POS systems where data is stored online. Typical hardware needs for POS set-ups include: credit-card swipers, computer terminals, monitors, bar-code scanners, receipt printers, touchscreens, computer peripherals such as keyboards and mice, and cash-drawers. Retain old customers, earn new ones and increase sales by offering free meals.</p>

<p>A&B POS is a full-featured point-of-sale solution that provides simple but powerful functionalities in terms of taking orders, providing discounts and tips, managing inventory, and generating daily reports for insights on your business.
