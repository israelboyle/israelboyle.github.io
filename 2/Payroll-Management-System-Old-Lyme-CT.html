They offer a multi-tier loyalty feature which permits business owners to track how much their customers spend, and offer rewards as they seem fit.</p>
<p>The hardware of a POS system consists of the physical setup like cash register connected to a PC or server, or even a portable device such as a tablet or smartphone connected to a cloud-hosted system.
