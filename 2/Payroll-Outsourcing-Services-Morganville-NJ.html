With this feature, if your business receives a reminder to refill a stock of inventory, you'll simply have to press a few buttons within your POS to do so. Keep in mind that first you'll have to onboard your vendors into your POS system.</p>

Cash registers are not as evolved as using a POS system and lack many of the functions and features of a modern day point of sale system like Square Point of Sale A cash register could be considered a point of sale solution technically, however, for our definitions, we will be focusing on point-of-sale machines (aka POS terminals) that involve both software and hardware.</p>
<p>As with any hybrid POS (part software, part Cloud) that relies on a consistent and robust data stream, if your business has problems with connectivity, you may have issues.
