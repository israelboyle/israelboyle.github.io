Toast is an all-in-one management solution for restauranteurs. Getting holistic, real-time data in the hands of key decision makers allows them to take immediate action and improve performance in your stores. Any store that has a point of sale and point of purchase can use POS software.</p>

<p>We know how many hats business owners wear each day and created an ePOS software and eCommerce system that simply works well and works right, while enabling a competitive advantage. Inventory management — Linking back-of-house and front-of-house functions is crucial, and many restaurant POS systems include inventory management features that allow you to be on top of sourcing and purchasing. Traditionally, POS systems were on-premise, which means they used an on-site server and could only run in a specific area of your store.</p>
