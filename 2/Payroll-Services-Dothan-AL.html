<p>You may, for example, not need a cash drawer if the majority of sales are through card. Mobile POS systems allow employees to mingle with your customers on the store floor, deterring shoplifting. For example, you could ask customers questions such as "do you ever shop with us online?" or "would you be interested in a frequent shopper program?"
