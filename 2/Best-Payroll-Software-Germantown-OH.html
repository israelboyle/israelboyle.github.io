Lavu POS systems centralize your data storage in a cloud-based system to give management complete control over the program. Using the right POS solution for your restaurant can expedite more than just food orders.</p>

Just as there are many different types of restaurants, so there are many different types of POS systems, and like any tool it is important to choose the right one for the job.</p>

Keep in mind that first you'll have to onboard your vendors into your POS system.</p>
