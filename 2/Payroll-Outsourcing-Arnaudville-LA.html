<p>You may think of point-of-sale (PoS) systems as just ordinary cash registers, but they're evolving to do much more. Order management: Process customer orders and generate bills digitally, making it easier to track sales and catch mistakes. Inventory management: Many POS systems help you keep track of your product inventory, allowing you to enter specific details about each item you sell and track your product receiving, sales, and shipping.</p>
<p>If your business is lean and mean, or if you're episodically using the POS, you'll only pay the processing fee of 2.75% per charge for credit cards (the fee is slightly higher for cash payments). In short, therefore, you can think of the whole thing as a centralized restaurant management system.
