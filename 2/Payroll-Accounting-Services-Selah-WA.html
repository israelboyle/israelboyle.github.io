<p>The core of hospitality or retail business, for that matter any trade, is the cash register. After all, with customers increasingly expecting the latest and greatest tech, you don't want to be known as the bar that delivers a poor experience with dated equipment. This will include hardware components like credit card readers, touchscreen monitors, receipt printers, and barcode scanners. The key to servicing such a wide variety of retailers is our commitment to work with you directly to customize a system to meet your unique business needs.</p>
<p>As a smaller restaurant, don't feel duped into buying the more complex POS systems. While POS software features that help streamline operations are essential, both hardware and software should be designed with efficiency, effectiveness, and ease-of-use in mind. If you are a retail business that needs more than just a light-weight cloud POS system, POSIM is right for you. Systems such as Square Point of Sale are known for offering small dongles that connect to a tablet and let you swipe credit cards on the go. While you may not immediately need this type of mobility, it is good to know that it's available.</p>

AB POS is one of the top retail POS solutions that offer robust POS terminals, ecommerce gateways, and software apps. Retail software is great for clothing stores and furniture outlets, but they don't serve the restaurant industry as well. Simply explained, every time your customer purchases your business, they're completing a point of the sale transaction.</p>
<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity. At the same time, a good POS system will allow you to accept cash, credit, and contactless payments and some will even let you accept online payments for your products and services.</p>
