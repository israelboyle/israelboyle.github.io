<p>This feature has been around since I started in the cash register business some 25+ years ago. Integration of other aspects of the business with the bar POS system : It will entail a lot less hassle if the management of the bar and the patrons can be integrated with the other aspects of maintaining a business. Before diving into why a retail POS is not ideal for a restaurant, let's take a step back a first talk about what a point of sale is and why you should use one in the first place. With Instore, you can take orders and accept payments from anywhere in your store, manage your menu or product catalog, analyze sales data, track inventory, issue gift cards, and customize receipts with coupons and special offers.</p>
<p>If your bar has a kitchen and serves food, easily send orders from front of the house to kitchen display systems in the back. This restaurant POS gives managers control over guest reservations, inventory management, staff management, and more. Lavu POS systems centralize your data storage in a cloud-based system to give management complete control over the program. Using the right POS solution for your restaurant can expedite more than just food orders.</p>
<p>Substitutions, drink recipe lists, price scheduling, tab management, and split inventory for liquor pours are just a few features to look for in bar POS software. Another important aspect of POS software is broad support for new payment systems. Lightspeed register terminals are iPad-based and provide access to the backend business management system. However, it is advisable to opt for the software that best suits your business requirements and smoothens your business operations to provide top-notch customer service.</p>

<p>It can be all too easy to lose track of someone's drink order or miss a customer waiting to place a drink order at the bar.
