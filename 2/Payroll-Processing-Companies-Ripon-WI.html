The QuickBooks POS is essentially a separate business software that can be used in support of the overall QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions package.

Adapt to your customers' needs with convertible point of sale systems.</p>

Add to that robust multi-location management tools and an amazing array of ready integrations, and you tailor Lightspeed to fit your exact bar service needs. Offer customers the option of leaving a security deposit or partial payment towards items instead of paying all at once. From the console, retailers can create products, check stock, change prices, run sales reports, and more.</p>
