<p>A gift shop needs specialist POS software if the business is to reach its full potential. Even before the actual transaction, your employees or you will need to ring your customers up. In this crucial step, your point of sale shouldn't slow down the process—having a point of sale system with an easily navigable inventory catalog for quickly ringing up customers will seriously speed up your checkout process.

The point of sale system can be integrated with your other systems and software such as eCommerce platforms, accounting apps, ERP and warehouse systems. With traditional licensed based POS system, the only knowledge possible to obtain prior to purchase comes from words from your sales rep or doing as much research as possible to find reviews online.</p>
