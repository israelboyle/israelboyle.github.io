<p>Point of sale or POS systems are a necessary and invaluable part of most businesses. Restaurants need the ability to securely sell, track and redeem gift card transactions without transaction fees. For example, some restaurants require that items selected by the customers be attended to and can only be placed by the waiter who has the password required to do so. This prevents fake orders - such as may be entered by playful kids - and subsequent dispute on the items ordered. Collecting information even before your guests walk in your restaurant will keep you better prepared for your staff pre-service.</p>
<p>Restaurant Point of Sale Systems do much more than the typical Restaurant POS Cash Register. With a handheld mPOS your customers do not need to line up and wait at the counter when they have to place an order. The customers were required to go to the cash register where their credit cards could be processed. A typical EPoS system in not capable of being all things to all men, so it's essential that it has the capacity to be integrated into other systems within the business.</p>
<p>The need for special tax calculations arise when you sell an item in the restaurant where the tax is added onto the sale but the same item in the bar has the tax included. With Zomato Book, you get benefits and features commonly found in the higher prices POS systems. But, taking the time to do your homework on point of sale systems can really pay off. Pre-authorization feature works great for bar tabs and lets customers hold onto their credit cards while they party.</p>

<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity. At the same time, a good POS system will allow you to accept cash, credit, and contactless payments and some will even let you accept online payments for your products and services.</p>
