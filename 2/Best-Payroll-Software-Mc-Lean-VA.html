A feature that every retail business owner loves from their POS systems is the reporting feature.</p>
<p>However, customers tend to abandon their cards if the balances get below a certain amount. Built with advanced inventory features, in-house marketing capabilities, and the ability to integrate with virtually any payment processor, talech takes your standard POS to the next level. Some point of sale systems only accept online payments. By using an API-led approach to connectivity, Buffalo Wild Wings was able to integrate their POS system to not one, but three systems--creating a unique solution that provides their restaurant chains with unprecedented visibility into their beer inventory.</p>

Track your sales, inventory, employees and customers - everything you need to know in one place.

In fact, an online presence has become so necessary that some systems, such as Shopify POS and Vend POS, include it as part of their package. This should mean a terminal that is fast, easy to understand and quick to respond to the touch of the server, cashier or bar tender. Flexible, affordable and serviceable are the key functions that aptly describe our mPOS Point of sale software system.</p>
