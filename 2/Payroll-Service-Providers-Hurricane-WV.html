<p>In running a successful business, there are few things more important than money. A point of sale system also can manage inventory levels across multiple business locations, allowing you to centralize your tracking system rather than relying on separate inventory schedules for each location. Tracking inventory accurately is a particularly tough challenge for restaurants and bars because the majority of your products aren't in simple units. The menus are outfitted with desirable features that allow guests to place orders, enter custom cooking specifications, order drinks, request table service, tender secure payment (from the table) and view detailed descriptions of menu items-inclusive of high-resolution images and wine and beer pairing options.</p>
