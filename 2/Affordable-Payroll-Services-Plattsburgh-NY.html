At the same time updating between multiple stations and the back end administrative computer should be capable of being efficiently performed, so that on one hand either at the start of the day or at any time each station will have the latest inventory to process all items for sale, while on the other hand at the end of the day the back end administrative computer can be updated in terms of all sale records.</p>

<p>And an open API makes adding third-party applications far easier than with the majority of restaurant POS systems.

<p>Again, these exploits by hackers could only be made possible because payment cards were processed through the POS system allowing the malware to either intercept card data during processing or steal and transmit unencrypted card data that is stored in the system database. A POS should have customer relationship management (CRM) to track all customer data. Vend POS checks most of the boxes small businesses are looking for when it comes to a point-of-sale solution.</p>
<p>Ingeniously designed, Echo is for smaller do-it-yourself merchants that want something more robust than our free Casio cash register , but don't necessarily need the added features and functionality of our Elite free POS system.
