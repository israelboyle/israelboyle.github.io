Self-service kiosks - A large self-service kiosk can help customers serve themselves, saving your staff time. An online restaurant management system is essentially a web application that is developed to automate the daily activities of a restaurant.

The POS serves as the central component for your business ; it's the hub where everything—like sales, inventory and customer management—merges.</p>
