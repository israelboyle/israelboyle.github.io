<p>Whether your restaurant needs a new point of sale system or you are adding such a system for the very first time, here are some tips to help you pick out the best POS for your restaurant. The restaurant industry is well served by many different POS systems. Harbortouch Bar & Restaurant is one of the top rated and best POS systems on the market designed for restaurants, bars, nightclubs, and hospitality environments, but it doesn't stop there. If you are looking for the pos software development company then contact to BR Softech as we offer you the pos system for sale, point of sale software design.</p>
<p>Our restaurant point of sale (POS) systems are also designed to support the highest level of customer service, allowing you to create the dining experiences that will delight customers and earn their loyalty. Their interface allows you to present detailed menu options with photos, descriptions, and prices so new staff can familiarize themselves with the food in a flash. Combined, the tools are particularly handy for streamlining the management of multiple restaurant locations.</p>
<p>If you are already using a payment-processing service and want to stick with it, then you will want to look at POS systems which work with that system (usually called "integrated processing" since the outside company's payments are integrated into the POS). You want your POS system to be able to handle every method you might need including debit and credit cards, checks, and cash. Other Square features allow restaurants to send invoices, manage payroll and integrate with third-party applications such as QuickBooks, Xero and TaxJar.</p>

<p>Many of the trends within the restaurant POS software space are cloud-related. Customers experience an average annual sales growth rate that's more than 8%. That's higher than the national average. With the software, you get to manage your sales centrally with the platform syncing customers, sales, inventory, and products between the apps. You can take orders, manage tables and reservations, split checks, and accept payments with it. It manages inventory at the ingredient level, and its purchase-ordering system can automatically reorder supplies.</p>
<p>The company offers POS solutions for retailers and restaurants. Synchronize your online and retail customers. There's an option for remote management of the POS, too. Some restaurant point of sale systems come standard with an "86 Item Countdown" feature that displays actual counts, deducts from the count when an item is sold and then prevents sales of the item once it is sold out. It's fully customizable and suitable for all types of food establishments, such as full-service and quick-service restaurants, cafes, bakeries, bars, and nightclubs.</p>

<p>With integrated credit card processing you are assured that the amount of the sale will match the amount charged on the credit card, eliminating the need to go back and match individual sales when the credit card batch does not match credit card sales. Although cloud-based software is easy to deploy and maintain for most bars, Ligan said it can be slow and prone to crash if you have an unstable internet connection.</p>
<p>This helps you provide VIP treatment to your customers and allows your team to showcase your inventory while building customer trust. By using CAKE's employee management and basic timecards, you can clock in employees, track their breaks, and monitor overtime.

The software window has several columns such as items bought, quantity of each item, sales taxes, total payable amount, amount tendered and balance for the customer. Square POS has become one of the most widely used point of sale systems out there—and for good reason.</p>
<p>If you are operating a business, chances are good that you will need a point-of-sale (POS) system to complete consumer purchase transactions - and bars are no exception. Your software handles much more than the sale aspect of the transaction - retail management software is a more accurate description. POS packages frequently come with integrated accounting modules, including general ledger, accounts receivable, accounts payable, purchasing, and inventory control systems.</p>
