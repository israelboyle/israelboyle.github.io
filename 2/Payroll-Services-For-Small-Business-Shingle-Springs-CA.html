<p>There are EPoS systems which have been developed with the hospitality industry in mind. The cloud-based POS solution helps manage your stuff, serve customers accurately and in time, and monitor performance to depict trends and opportunities. With the diverse needs of different food establishments, no POS software is a fit-all solution.

<p>Designed specifically for wine, beer, and liquor stores, this POS software has inventory and customer management tools, more than 70 reports, and a built-in timeclock. One of the newer restaurant POS on the market, Rezku weighs in heavy with an easy-to-use, modern and sleek interface. It is part of the Shopify ecommerce suite that lets you manage a business from everywhere, including tracking inventory across channels, accepting any form of payment, applying discounts, emailing customers their receipts, and processing refunds.</p>
<p>FusionRestro includes accounting, billing, staff and payroll functions, inventory management, and customer information management. The user interface of Vision Store and Store Mobile is so robust, associates can execute a handful of requests in one easy, uninterrupted step: a purchase here, a return there, a loyalty card, a web order inquiry, a custom order — no problem. As much as customer engagement strategy differs between brands, one thing is consistent across the board: the POS is still the one thing that never fails to bring sales associate and customer together.</p>
