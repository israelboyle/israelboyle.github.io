<p>Point of sale or POS systems are a necessary and invaluable part of most businesses. Restaurants need the ability to securely sell, track and redeem gift card transactions without transaction fees. For example, some restaurants require that items selected by the customers be attended to and can only be placed by the waiter who has the password required to do so. This prevents fake orders - such as may be entered by playful kids - and subsequent dispute on the items ordered. Collecting information even before your guests walk in your restaurant will keep you better prepared for your staff pre-service.</p>
<p>Talech is perfect for restaurants and bars. Salespeople sometimes use it when they track inventory.
