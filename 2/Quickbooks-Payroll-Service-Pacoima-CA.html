<p>Basic point of sale systems currently in use include standalone electronic cash registers, also known as ECRs; ECR-based network systems; and controller-based systems. Cloud-based POS systems are different from traditional POS largely because user data, including sales and inventory, are not stored locally, but in a remote server. The software features advanced caller ID integration to easily manage incoming calls.</p>
<p>Many times it will have the MSR built in. Many large stores use mechanical keyboards which are rated for higher use than a standard consumer keyboard. Instead of an employee double-checking inventory or reconciling the cash register with the sales, the software performs the action. A cloud-based restaurant POS does both by providing an efficient system to modify menus and prices. Integration with 3rd Party Apps — businesses using POS systems need to make their data available to their ERP and accounting applications.</p>
